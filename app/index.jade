					The history of porn music goes way beyond boom chikka bow bow and wakka-chikka wakka-chikka cliches. Technical innovation, electronic experiments, strange sidetrips, Ennio Morricone, and even the Muppets play a part in the development of erotic film soundtracks. Marke B. guides you past the canned moans and awkward dialogue, into a world of sonic seduction.

			p.
				Porn, especially old-school porn from the golden age of the 1970s and '80s, may call up images of lurid voyeurism, cheesy encounters, and superhuman physical entanglements. But behind the badly dubbed lines and excruciating acting lay a world of adult erotic film auteurs who took themselves seriously as directors and producers, especially when it came to the soundtrack, that aspirational benchmark of film production. It wasn't all flailing flangers and overused wah-wahs. As with indie films today, lack of budget led to ingenuity -- and sometimes a bit of theft-as-homage -- throwing open the backdoor to innovations in sampling, dubbing, studio techniques, and electronic production. Even now, online porn producers are changing the way we hear (fake) sex.

			p.
				From their very start in the silent era, erotic films were obsessed with music and dance. 1896's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0duA3b4g_Q">La Coucher de Mariee</a>, was a cheerful, shimmying striptease performed by French cabaret star Louise Willey. That same year, Fatima's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxLJJK_ZQyM">Coochie Coochie Dance</a> featured forcefully suggestive, scandalously clad Syrian bellydancer Fatima Djemille, and was one of the first films to be censored.Distributed internationally by founding film fathers like Thomas Edison and the Pathe Brothers, these minute-long pulse-quickeners sparked a celluloid explosion of Kinetoscopic peep flicks in the early 20th century, exhibited everywhere from grand theaters to state fairs.

			p.
				The advent of sound films, however, coincided with a rise in film content censorship, at least in America. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code">stultifying Hays Code</a> rendered most erotic films mute for decades, denying anything even vaguely arousing access to big money Hollywood equipment, production, and distribution. Until the early 1960s (and beyond, in the case of gay films), erotic movies were limited to short, silent reels that could be looped at stag parties or passed hand-to-hand for basement and backroom viewing parties.

			p.
				As the Hays Code faded in the 1960s and the sexual revolution's first stirrings were felt, the appetite for porn films grew. A new circuit of adult movie theaters sprang up to service an audience unwelcome in mainstream cinemas. Many of these adult theaters utilized reel-to-reel projectors that could handle fancy 35mm film and were equipped with better sound soundsystems. They began to favor porn loops from distributors that contained music over the action, maybe some dialogue even, as a means of attracting a broader customer base and affording a little credibility as cinemas. (A group of dudes sitting silently in a theatre watching intercourse was apparently a turn-off for some people.) Adult films became a communal experience, albeit still mostly for men.

			p.
				They also became an musical genre unto themselves, as filmmakers and even cinema owners themselves dubbed hastily snatched soundtracks over the loops, cobbled together from edited segments of pop songs and soundtracks and reel-reel-recordings by studio musicians with probably grander ambitions. The <em>boom chikka bow wow</em> soundtrack that that pops into your head when you hear "adult film"? That well-worn "porno groove" is an unkillable artifact from that period, an amalgamation of early funk (Booker T. and the M.G.'s "Green Onions" is the template here), psychedelic rock, space age bachelor pad lounge music, and -- if the soundtrack featured pan flutes or a banjo, and it usually did -- pastoral folk. Easily slapped over hardcore loops, which could then be stitched together with the flimsiest of plots to create a feature, porno grooves were extremely flexible.

			p.
				Although the exact origin of the porno groove is shrouded in mystery and probable embarrassment, it proved to be more lasting than its orignators might have intended: Those wah-wah pedals, Hammond organ swirls, and piercing hi-hats have stuck. Five popular compilations -- 1999's <em>Pornosonic: Unreleased 70s Porno Music</em> (compiled by porn prince Ron Jeremy), 2004's <em>Wakka Chikka Wakka Chikka: Porn Music for the Masses</em>, 2009's <em>Porno Groove: The Sound of '70s Adult Films</em>, 2011's <em>Inside Deep Note: Music Of 1970's Adult Cinema</em>, and this year's <em>The Sound of Sexploitation</em> continue to exploit the titillating, tacky, endlessly fascinating genre.

			p.
				Not incidental to all this was the introduction, in 1965, of the affordable Super-8 home movie camera, equipped with sound recording capability. The film was still expensive, not to mention risky, to develop (amateur adult film impressarios were developing film in their bathtubs right up until the introduction of VHS), but allowed for great freedom of mobility and, with dialogue, semblances of plot. Filmmakers experimented wildly with soundtracks as well, cutting and pasting funk hits in the background and experimenting with cutting and dubbing. (Percussive, bongo-based tracks were favored, since they tended to best survive any warping or projection glitches.)

			p.
				The new '60s adult theater circuit also offered cross-over potential, especially as risque European art films like 1967's Swedish I Am Curious (Yellow) and 1969's Language of Love were rocketed to international success due to headline-grabbing censorship attempts. Despite the realist production values (Yellow, part political statement, part Goddard wannabe, had no soundtrack; Language, a faux-documentary, featured couples humping to Ravel's Bolero) these films -- along with others like I Am a Nymphomaniac, Inga and Greta (whose theme was composed by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaes of ABBA), I, a Woman, and Eugenie... The Story of Her Journey into Perversion, coupled with American Russ Meyer's busty, swingin', rock-babe B-movies (Vixen!, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls) -- awakened a yearning for fuller, more lavish adult film productions, ones that could cater to both the adult circuit and mainstream audiences.

			p.
				The apogee of the softcore Euro invasion, 1972's Last Tango in Paris, throbbed with soaring horns and weepy strings from Gato Barbieri and his orchestra, becoming a soundtrack classic. At the less pretentious end of the spectrum, the gothic sitars and brassy psych-jazz provided by composers Manfred Hübler and Sigi Schwab for Vampyros Lesbos (1971) and Gert Wilden and Orchestra's chugging, spacey acid rock for the early '70s Schoolgirl Report movies were re-released as bestsellers in the mid-1990s, at the height of the porno groove revival.

			p.
				One fantastically weird development that came out of this period: 1968 Italian mondo film Sweden: Heaven and Hell, about  lesbian nightclubs and the Scandanavian swingers scene (as well as drug addiction, suicide, and death) birthed one of the infernally catchiest tunes in pop history, "Ma nah ma nah," written by Pierre Umiliani and inexplicably adopted by the Muppets, who made it famous.

			p.
				In 1972, two films slaked the desire for big crossover hits that featured more hardcore sex, which ushered in the Golden Era of adult films -- and made the soundtrack an integral part of the experience. Behind the Green Door and Deep Throat grabbed the adult American imagination and finally broke onscreen sex into the mainstream.

			p.
				Behind the Green Door [trailer: https://vimeo.com/81346938] is mostly wordless -- star Marilyn Chambers has no dialogue at all -- so composer Daniel LeBlanc's soundtrack carries the film, taking advantage of its underground San Francisco locations (the movie chronicles Chambers' introduction to the city's wild nightlife) and cult-like sex scenes to indulge in a few funky freakouts and psychedelic breakdowns. The film boasted full music and sound departments. Directed and produced by San Francisco strip club impressarios the Mitchell Brothers and boasting full music and sound departments, Green Door deliberately put the soundtrack high in the mix -- the brothers knew that potential patrons passing by theaters would be intrigued by what they heard coming from inside.

			p.
				Deep Throat took another tack, a hardcore movie aiming for soft pop success and oddball whimsy -- and scoring as a pop culture juggernaut that seized the media's attention and broke box office records. Star Linda Lovelace discovers her clitoris is located in her throat: you'd expect a lot of warbling on the soundtrack, but no -- bubblegum pop ("Blowin' Bubbles"), showtune excess ("Deep Throat"), breezy light rock ("La La La") and kooky snippets of dialogue round out what was eventually released as a double album. What made the movie, and the soundtrack, especially famous -- beyond the fact that it was the first real mainstream porn -- was that the FBI seized the masters of both the film and the music in the wake of the many obscenity trials that were to follow the movie's release. The soundtrack is still regarded as a classic; vinyl copies sell for well into the hundreds of dollars.

			p.
				Those two films, along with others like Mona (acknowledged to be the link between 8mm film loops and full production features), Boys in the Sand (the first wide release gay-themed film, and the first reviewed by Variety magazine), The Devil in Miss Jones, The Opening of Misty Beethoven, Debbie Does Dallas, and more ushered in an era of porn chic, influencing everything from fashion to Hollywood film soundtracks. Hundreds of full features were rushed through production, and included large casts and technical crews, special effects and artsy details, and fully credited soundtrack composers, sound editors, and post-production technicians.

			p.
				A couple notable soundtracks from this era: legendary funk drummer Bernard "Pretty" Purdy's groovy soundtrack for 1974 sexploitation-Blaxploitation groundbreaker "Lialeh" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdc0L8B0bC0] and Alden Shuman's haunting soft rock for 1973's The Devil in Miss Jones. But the rush for the next Deep Throat also meant some corners were cut, especially when it came to music.

			p.
				"We basically stole it, most of the time," laughed golden-age adult film director and star William Margold when I asked him about the origins of porno groove. "Well, at worst we stole it. At best, we plagiarized with good intentions. This was during an era when, despite enormous successes, we were still an outlaw business, making movies that were outlawed. So even our soundtracks operated outside the law."

			p.
				In his 40-year career, Margold has appeared in more that 500 scenes in 300 movies -- from 1972's The Goddaughter to 2014's Hackin' Jack and the Chainsaw Chicks, with Nudes at Eleven, Disco Dolls in Hot Skin, and Butts Motel 3 in between. He's also directed dozens of them, from on-the-fly parodies to full productions. Now he acts as a porn historian (he prefers the term "practorian" since "Hey, I've done it all") and writes the film review column for the LA Xpress adult magazine.

			p.
				"Ennio Morricone was the big one -- there was something about his soundtrack work that was just so visceral, but also could be very funky. If you ran most of the adult films from the '70s through a program, most of the music would come up Morricone. We really cared about the music and we cared about the films. Morricone is a cool guy, we thought he would get that we were giving him a whole new audience. Either that or he would too embarrased to go after us.

			p.
				"It was a period when you had absolute artistic freedom -- and we aspired to art, even in the movies with less than a few days' turnaround. The music was essential. Many of us were auteurs. We had delusions of grandeur.  We felt we could compete with the big guys. The Opening of Misty Beethoven was filmed in three countries with an original score. Midnight Cowboy was the first X-rated picture to win an Oscar, and it had John Lennon's backing band on the soundtrack." As a favorite auteur example, he points to cult director Roger Watkins' affecting and strange 1979 Her Name Was Lisa, an erotic film about the life of a dead heroin addict, for which Watkins wrote a Rolling Stones-esque semi-hit called "Don't Let Go of Your Soul." The movie also includes a note-perfect redo of Kraftwerk's "Robots."

			p.
				"We had to operate in so many genres, because we did a lot of parodies," Margold told me. "If you were doing something from a particular time period in a particular style, you wanted to get every detail right, from the look to the soundtrack. If you were doing Backside to the Future, you really tried to nail it." 

			p.
				Margold continued: "And in some places, sure, we'd take it over the top. In Marilyn and the Senator" -- a renowned 1975 flick that plays off Washington's post-Watergate chaos, stars assistant director Margold as the Senator, and received a deluxe DVD reissue last year -- "we used Mussorgsky's 'Great Gate of Kiev.' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw7OM_Q810k] Now that was pretty bombastic. We just thought, 'What a great piece of music for the cumshot."

			p.
				(Because it's often royalty-free, you'll find a lot of classical music on golden age porn soundtracks. One famous example: The Opening of Misty Beethoven uses the "William Tell Overture" during a very climactic scene.)

			p.
				For many of his movies, Margold worked with one of the biggest names in original adult film soundtrack writing, Jimmy Mack, the nom-de-porn of Grant Saidiner, who composed music for Deep Throat II, Sleazy Rider, Return to Camp Beaver Lake, and "too many more to count," Saidiner told me from his Los Angeles home. His career spanned three decades, until multiple sclerosis forced his retirement in the '90s. Along with his producer wife Mara Epstein, he even scored a crossover B-movie success, with 1996 teensploitation movie South Beach Academy, starring Corey Feldman and Ron Jeremy.

			p.
				Working off a four-track reel-to-reel, Saidiner would compose and sequence his tracks to the edited VHS tapes that Wardlaw and others would provide. "I would do my best to create not only music that would highlight the moods of specific scenes," Saidiner said, "but to make the film come together as a whole."

			p.
				"Grant was known as a one-man band in the industry, because he would handle all the instrumentation, playing piano, organ, and synthesizers," Epstein told me. "Of course, for the bigger productions, we would have a full band in here: saxophones, violins, guitars, vocals. He once had me and our neighbors in to sing the chorus on a film called Lesbo A Go-Go and now whenever we see each other, even 20 years later, we can't stop singing 'Lesbo A Go-Go, Lesbo A Go-Go, Lesbo A Go-Go!'"
